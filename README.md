# Efficient 3D Dose Generation with Latent Diffusion

### Description
Radiotherapy dose calculation requires many intermediate time-consuming steps until
delivery, while itself can also be quite time-consuming and challenging. Deep Learning
and Generative Modeling have shown great potential in creating real-world usable doses.
We provide a framework to automate the configuration, training and evaluation of 
efficient 3D dose generation models based on Latent Diffusion. We experiment with using
the mask labels for conditioning together with the images, and with simultaneous mask
and dose generation, conditioned only with images.

This project is inspired from [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) and heavily based on 
[MONAI generative models](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels). Given a 
dataset, nnU-Net automatically configures all the hyperparamaters that should be used 
for this dataset on a segmentation task. We follow the same idea to define robust enough
hyperparameters for the task of training diffusion-latent diffusion models for dose and
mask generation based on MONAI generative models.

## Usage Instructions

### Environment variables

First, set some environment variables for the main dataset results folders:

```bash
export dosegen_preprocessed="/path_to_your_folder/dosegen_preprocessed"
export dosegen_results="/path_to_your_folder/dosegen_results"
```
All the preprocessed folders of this project will be stored in dosegen_preprocessed,
and similarly all the results in dosegen_results.


### Dataset preparation

- We follow initial dataset formats similar the [Medical Segmentation Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/).
- To train models with this library you must put all your files in a folder with a name
of the form: TaskXXX_DatasetName, where XXX should be a 3-digit number, potentially
starting with 0s. 
- All the images, doses and label masks should be in .nii.gz format.
- The images should be stored in a folder called 'images', the doses in one called 
'doses' and the masks in a folder called 'labels'.

[//]: # (This should create a dataset in the nnUNet_raw folder called Dataset001_MyDataset, )

[//]: # (splitting multiple channel images to separate images. For other available dataset )

[//]: # (format options take a look at nnUNet documentation.)

### Dataset preprocessing

To preprocess a dataset and make it ready for latent diffusion training run:

```bash
dosegen_plan_and_preprocess /path_to_dataset
```

This will create a new folder in your dosegen_preprocessed folder containing:
- .zarr files with the images, doses and masks
- a dosegen.yaml configuration file with all the parameters/hyperparameters of the 
project

[//]: # (Given a new dataset, nnU-Net will extract a dataset fingerprint &#40;a set of )

[//]: # (dataset-specific properties such as image sizes, voxel spacings, intensity )

[//]: # (information etc&#41;. This information is used to design three U-Net configurations. )

[//]: # (Each of these pipelines operates on its own preprocessed version of the dataset.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The easiest way to run fingerprint extraction, experiment planning and )

[//]: # (preprocessing is to use:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (nnUNetv2_plan_and_preprocess -d DATASET_ID --verify_dataset_integrity)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (This will create a new subfolder in your nnUNet_preprocessed folder named after the )

[//]: # (information check nnU-Net documentation.)


### Training

All the training commands include these arguments:
- DATASET_ID: corresponds to the numeric dataset identifier (e.g., 001 for Brain Tumour
dataset from Medical Segmentation Decathlon)
- SPLITTING: should be one of ['train-val-test', '5-fold'], defining the type of data 
splitting 
- MODEL_TYPE: should be either '2d' or '3d' 
- -p: indicates that we want to see progress bars.


#### Latent Diffusion Model
To train a Latent Diffusion Model, first we need to train an autoencoder:

```bash
dosegen_train_autoencoder DATASET_ID SPLITTING MODEL_TYPE -p
```
After finishing training, we can then train the Latent Diffusion Model:

```bash
dosegen_train_ldm DATASET_ID SPLITTING MODEL_TYPE -p
```

#### Output Files
Running an experiment will create a directory in dosegen_results path with the 
following folders and files: 
- checkpoints folder: contains the checkpoints of the last and the best epoch of 
training (the best one is derived based on the validation reconstruction loss)
- plots folder: in this folder a loss.png file will be saved for every kind of
training, showing the training and validation losses per epoch. Moreover, a gif will 
be saved in this folder (with frequency based on the argument 'val_plot_interval' 
in the config file) in case of 3D training, and a slice in case of 2D. For ddpm 
and ldm, the figures contain generated examples across the z direction, 
while for the autoencoder, an actual image and its reconstruction are visualized.
- loss_dict.pkl: a file containing lists with loss values per epoch


#### Tips for Training

- To continue training a model, just pass -c when running the training command.

[//]: # (- The autoencoder shouldn't have more than 2-3 downsampling layers, otherwise it )

[//]: # (won't be able to reconstruct details accurately.)

[//]: # (- Only a few convolutional filters for every layer of the autoencoder &#40;e.g., 32&#41;, )

[//]: # (can result in good enough reconstruction performance. )

[//]: # (- Loss weights in the training of the autoencoder are really important. Some works)

[//]: # (might use relatively small loss weights for the perceptual loss &#40;e.g., 0.01&#41; and the)

[//]: # (adversarial loss &#40;e.g., 0.1&#41;, but based on experiments a value of 1, and 0.25, )

[//]: # (respectively, gives much better and realistic results.)

### Sampling (<span style="color:red">*Will be added*</span>)

To sample doses with your model conditioned on images (and labels) run:

```bash
dosegen_sample DATASET_ID MODEL_TYPE NUM_IMAGES SAVE_PATH -p
```
This will sample NUM_IMAGES images and save them in SAVE_PATH.
